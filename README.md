### What is this repository for? ###

This is the repository for an Agent-Based Model developed in MATLAB to simulate the performance on an infrastructure system whose operation has been delegated to a private party (e.g., a public-private partnership). 

### How do I use it? ###

You need to have installed MATLAB 2014b or later.

From the MATLAB environment, the model can be run in two ways:

* By executing the `main.m` file. This runs the selected experiment without showing a GUI.
* By executing the `gui.m` file. This lauches the GUI from which you can select an experiment to run.
